Growing
up,
whenever
 you
heard
.We.d
like a
word
with
you!.
from
your
parents,
 you
knew
they
might
be
peeved
at you.
Well,
we.re
not
upset
with
you,
but we
still
want a
word.
Hopefull
y you
can
decode
the
answer
to this
field
puzzle
easily,
so you
will
not be
upset
with us.

In a
quiet
section
of
Northamp
ton
Park,
you
will
find
the
puzzle.
All
that
you
need to
do is
determin
e the
secret
word
that
will
allow
you to
open
the
outer
containe
r and
get
access
to the
actual
log
sheets.
We
picked
the
spot to
be off
trail
enough
to
provide
some
privacy,
 and
there
is even
a
fallen
tree to
use as
a bench.

 
Simply
align
the
letters
with
the
arrows,
forming
the
secret
word,
and
pull
the
containe
r apart
to
obtain
the
inner
bison
tube.
The
same
word
needs
to be
lined
up
properly
 when
you
re-assem
ble the
containe
r.
Please
handle
the
containe
r with
care
we're
not
sure
how
rugged
it is.
Thanks.

Unlike
our
Order
of
Operatio
ns
cache
(GC3RWE5
) in
Mendon
Ponds,
you
will
not be
required
 to do
any
math,
so
hopefull
y this
will
appeal
to more
people.
We
regard
this
puzzle
as
easier
than
that
one.

The
only
log
that is
valid
to
record
this
cache
as a
find is
the one
in the
cryptix.
 We
WILL
delete
online
finds
without
a
correspo
nding
entry
in the
proper
log.
You
have
been
warned.

 

How
will
you
know
what
the
special
word
is? We
doubt
that
saying
.That.s
for us
to know
and you
to find
out."
will be
a
source
of
relief.
We will
tell
you
it.s a
6
letter
word.
(Althoug
h some
of you
may
mutter
a few
words
that
are a
couple
letters
short
of that
whilst
trying
to open
this,
but
those
words
will
not be
of any
help. )
