Growing up, whenever you heard .We.d like a word with you!. from your parents, you knew they might be peeved at you. Well, we.re not upset with you, but we still want a word. Hopefully you can decode the answer to this field puzzle easily, so you will not be upset with us.

In a quiet section of Northampton Park, you will find the puzzle. All that you need to do is determine the secret word that will allow you to open the outer container and get access to the actual log sheets. We picked the spot to be off trail enough to provide some privacy, and there is even a fallen tree to use as a bench.

 
Simply align the letters with the arrows, forming the secret word, and pull the container apart to obtain the inner bison tube. The same word needs to be lined up properly when you re-assemble the container. Please handle the container with care we're not sure how rugged it is. Thanks.

Unlike our Order of Operations cache (GC3RWE5) in Mendon Ponds, you will not be required to do any math, so hopefully this will appeal to more people. We regard this puzzle as easier than that one.

The only log that is valid to record this cache as a find is the one in the cryptix. We WILL delete online finds without a corresponding entry in the proper log. You have been warned.

 

How will you know what the special word is? We doubt that saying .That.s for us to know and you to find out." will be a source of relief. We will tell you it.s a 6 letter word. (Although some of you may mutter a few words that are a couple letters short of that whilst trying to open this, but those words will not be of any help. )
